<div class="p4 center fs120">CONSTIPATION AND ITS CORRECTION
BY EXERCISE</div>

<p>Constipation or dyskinesia is one of the important
influences in making people old before
their time. The breaking down of the faculties
and functions supposed to be due to old
age is in reality due to the accumulation of
waste and bacteria in the intestines. A habit
of life which keeps the bowels clean will set
“old age” back to the time when men will enjoy
perfect health to the utmost limit of a normal
span of years (at the present time the normal
span is fifty-eight years).</p>

<p>There are many people who think they are
quite normal, though they never had a regular
daily movement of the bowels without the aid
of laxatives in years. Yet, these same persons
will not let the gasoline line on their automobile
stay clogged one day.</p>

<p>The body is a very delicate organism and it
must be taken care of in a thoughtful fashion.
A poisoned night is spent if a day is missed
without a bowel movement, for the body cannot
carry waste a great length of time without
serious injury to it. Under a normal life the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
bowels should move at least once a day without
artificial aid.</p>


<p class="noindent"><i>Results of Constipation</i></p>

<p>When food remains too long in the body it
decays, putrefies, and develops into very active
poisons. With this decaying comes a depressing
feeling caused by these wastes being absorbed
into the blood. Then, to make matters
worse, this putrification retards the bowel
action, thus keeping the poisons in the body.
Thus, constipation results. Some of these
poisons are not so harmful, yet others are very
capable of infecting the body, and these enter
the blood stream via the intestines and reach
other organs where they may cause a chronic
disease.</p>

<p>Constipation brings many other ills besides
that of poisoning and infecting the body. If
this decay occurs too frequently, very serious
infections may develop. Frequently diseases
associated with old age, such as rheumatism,
kidney trouble, and disturbances of the gall
bladder are the result of a constipated condition
which has run for years. The retained
masses of putrefied food in the digestive tract
many times displaces and distends the bowels
with the ultimate result that it reacts on the
nervous system and the circulation of the liver,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
and causes much suffering. Appendicitis is
often traced to the continuous constipated condition.</p>

<p>Other results of constipation can be dizziness,
offensive breath, headache, loss of pep
and vitality, bad temper, poor complexion, stomach
disorders, skin eruptions, sleepless nights,
loss of appetite, stupor, and piles.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CAUSES_OF_CONSTIPATION">CAUSES OF CONSTIPATION</h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent"><i>Lack of Exercise</i></p>

<p>One who leads an inactive life must expect
to have a flabby body. Lack of exercise lowers
the tone of the whole body and especially the
abdominal viscera. This is an unhealthy way
to live, for it offers no incentive to the stomach
and intestines for the vigorous digestion of
food. A good workout daily will stimulate
and tone the intestines for better functioning.</p>

<p>Unless your work involves a great deal of
outdoor walking, a daily walk cannot be over-estimated
in the treatment of constipation.
Learn to stride along with the head and chest
up, breathing deeply. Walking in this fashion
will do as much good the last ten minutes as
the first ten. This exercise will stimulate the
appetite and increase the physical and mental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
tone of the body. It is a life-enriching as well
as life-purifying habit.</p>

<p>Learn to take a few workouts in the gym
every week, that is, if you are physically able.
However, before you plan your workout have
your health doctor plan your program and limitations
and what it should include.</p>

<p>In the back of the book will be found exercises
that will aid in the correction of constipation.
These exercises will be found very
beneficial if used daily.</p>


<p class="noindent"><i>Improper Diet</i></p>

<p>One of the chief causes of constipation is improper
diet. Correct feeding alone may cure
constipation. Even this rule has its exception,
for there is a form of constipation associated
with proper diet. This brings out the point
that it is essential to have a health examination
frequently by your family doctor, for he will
give you correct knowledge of the condition
of your body immediately.</p>

<p>Before taking up the matter of food, it must
be remembered that the purpose of this book
is to give exercises to cure constipation and
not to plan a diet. Your doctor will give you
a correct diet. However, it is essential that
the food should be chewed until it is almost a
pulp before swallowing. This will aid the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
stomach and whole digestive tract in assimilating
the food.</p>

<p>The spirit of happiness and cheerfulness is
important when eating. It cannot be over-emphasized.
In fact, laughter during the meal
time is very good for the digestive tract in digesting
the food. This buoyancy of the mind
will aid a great deal in the correction of constipation.
It is the only exercise that can be
used successfully while eating. Do not be downcast
while eating, as this will prevent normal
digestion.</p>

<p>The typical breakfast is usually orange juice,
eggs, toast or rolls and coffee. This breakfast
will satisfy hunger and supply energy, but it
does not meet the demands of health. It is
true that this breakfast includes the necessary
nutriments, but it does not contain bulk or
roughage, which are sometimes desirable in order
to give the bowels something to work upon.</p>

<p>In order to give the body foods with roughage
bran may be used in moderation. However,
bran does not agree with everyone. The indulgence
in this food should depend upon the advice
of your physician.</p>

<p>Fruit will cure constipation quicker than any
constipation remedies ever advertised. Oranges,
orange juice, figs, dates, and prunes are very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
good for the prevention as well as the correction
of constipation. It is a very excellent idea
to have some form of fruit for every meal. It
cannot be over-emphasized.</p>

<p>Vegetables are an absolute necessity in everyone’s
diet. Nature gives us food values that
cannot be estimated in importance. They clean
the interior of the body and act as a broom in
the digestive tract, that is, if they are eaten
twice a day. They are a mechanical necessity
to the intestines. Their bulk is absolutely
needed to stimulate the intestines to activity.</p>

<p>Foods which contain no mechanical stimulation
such as purées and gruel are open to objection.
Pastries are very constipating due to
the pasty element, for the secretions of the digestive
tract cannot assimilate them. The
psychic effect of a monotonous diet may cause
poor digestion resulting in constipation. Such
foods as eggs, milk, cheese—particularly cottage,
pot smearcase and cream, white rice, tea,
chocolate are said to be constipating because
they seem to slow up the action of the intestinal
tract.</p>

<p>On the whole, eat foods that originally gave
the human race its vigor, and you will get all
the food values, the sunshine, and fresh air,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
which that food has absorbed during the days
of its growth.</p>


<p class="noindent"><i>Laxatives</i></p>

<p>Laxatives do not cure constipation. They
may serve to make it chronic. Yet one
fourth of the people use them regularly. They
only give artificial stimulation to the bowel
movements. Every laxative, no matter how
innocent in itself, is a habit forming drug for
the bowels. They lash the bowel into action
once or twice or a few times. After that the
bowels will refuse to work without a laxative
administered. The dose becomes larger and
larger until heroic doses are consumed. NO
LAXATIVE OR ANY FORM OF BOWEL
WASHING SHOULD BE TAKEN UNLESS
ADVISED BY A PHYSICIAN.</p>


<p class="noindent"><i>Posture</i></p>

<p>Poor posture ranks on a par with lack of
exercise and improper diet in the cause of constipation.
Poor posture aids in the slipping
of the abdominal organs out of their respective
places, resulting in a tangled mass which will
act as an interference on the normal bowel
action. As a general rule, poor posture hinders
deep breathing. Thus, there is no compressing
movement upon the organs of the abdominal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
regions, such as is found in a normal upright
person. Deep, vigorous breathing is an aid to
a normal bowel movement. Good posture is an
absolute necessity for the freedom of the bowel
acting.</p>


<p class="noindent"><i>During Defecation</i></p>

<p>Faulty posture during defecation causes insufficient
emptying or difficulty in moving the
bowels at all. Many closet seats are too high.
The proper altitude is one that brings the
knees a little higher than the posterior.</p>

<p>A high closet seat can be remedied by using
a footstool to support the feet, thus bringing
the body into proper posture.</p>


<p class="noindent"><i>Hurried Defecation</i></p>

<p>A normal defecation ordinarily takes about
two to three minutes, but owing to the abuse
of resisting the call, ordinary defecation is not
always secured in the normal time. Thus residue
is left in the large intestine. This offers
difficulty when a call comes some later hour,
for the residue becomes hard and dry. This
residue in the colon results in the condition
known as</p>


<p class="noindent"><i>Irregularity in Answering Call</i></p>

<p>Irregularity in answering nature’s call causes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
irregularity of bowel action. Nature’s call
means that enough waste is in the colon to
cause automatic processes to set in action the
bowel movement.</p>

<p>If for any reason the bowels are not permitted
to move at once, the call usually disappears
in a few minutes and may not reappear
for some time. Thus, the wastes lie in the
colon with the water in them being absorbed
by the intestine, causing the wastes to become
dry. Due to these wastes remaining in the
intestine distention is produced in the colon
and defecation may become difficult or impossible
without mechanical aid.</p>

<p>The water of the waste which is absorbed
into the blood stream affects the body, causing
lower vitality and fatigue affecting the nerves.</p>


<p class="noindent"><i>Treatment</i></p>

<p>Hygiene is an important factor in restoring
the body to a condition of health. The various
abuses of the body that make for constipation
should be corrected. General habits, and especially
that of neglecting nature’s call, should be
corrected. Without good hygiene the treatment
of constipation cannot be successful.</p>


<p class="noindent"><i>Proper Diet</i></p>

<p>See your doctor and have him make out a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
proper diet. However, the diet should contain
a sufficient amount of roughage, such as vegetables,
fruits, and bran. Milk should be used
for its vitamin qualities and nourishment.</p>


<p class="noindent"><i>Rules for Proper Eating</i></p>

<ol>
<li>Do not eat too much.</li>
<li>Do not study your food while eating.</li>
<li>Enjoy what you eat.</li>
<li>Chew your food until it swallows itself.</li>
<li>Eat regularly.</li>
<li>Do not eat when tired.</li>
<li>Take a brisk short walk after eating, as
this is an aid to the digestive processes.</li>
</ol>

<p class="noindent"><i>Laxatives and Enemas</i></p>

<p>These should be used only upon the consent
of your doctor. They do not cure, and if possible
should be avoided.</p>


<p class="noindent"><i>Mental Attitude</i></p>

<p>Patience is necessary, and the feeling “I
can’t” should be changed to “I will.” This
feeling can do more than drugs. Do not hurry
defecation.</p>


<p class="noindent"><i>Regularity</i></p>

<p>Visit the toilet at least once a day—not to
read but to move the bowels. Aim to establish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
a habit by visiting the toilet the same time
every day.</p>


<p class="noindent"><i>Use of Water</i></p>

<p>Most people drink too little water. Six glasses
of water a day is the minimum and eight are
better. Even more should be taken in hot
weather. Avoid ice water, for it chills the
stomach. If ice water is the only water available,
sip it slowly.</p>

<p>Water should be taken freely between meals.
A glass at each meal will help digestion, and
there is nothing that so helps the bowels as a
glass or two of water before retiring.</p>


<p class="noindent"><i>Bathing</i></p>

<p>After taking the exercises described in the
back of the book a bath should be taken. Take
a shower or tub bath for two minutes with the
temperature between 95° and 100° F. for cleansing
purposes. This should be followed by a
quick cold rub over the entire body. Dry with
a rough towel until the skin glows. This should
be followed by a cold wet towel rubbed on the
abdomen for a few minutes until it attains a
reddish glow. Then dry the body thoroughly,
dress quickly, and you will have a keen appetite
for the morning meal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span></p>


<p class="noindent"><i>Exercises</i></p>

<p>The effectiveness of certain exercises in overcoming
constipation has been scientifically
proved. Diet alone will not cure constipation.
Diet and exercise should be used together, and
the victim of constipation should not neglect
either. Suitable diet and proper exercises can
usually be relied upon to cure the most obstinate
case of constipation. They will very frequently
banish that tired feeling and make one
tingle with energy and vitality.</p>

<p>Every one needs exercise other than his work,
for work tires the same old muscles and the
same old back day after day, while it neglects
the vital muscles around the waist. Work
wearies, while exercise refreshes. Exercise
builds up the muscular system and makes work
easier. Exercise may be harmful if too vigorous,
and if the patient is not accustomed to it.
These exercises as described below should be
indulged in mildly at first, and as the body becomes
accustomed to exercise increase the dosage.</p>

<p>Monotony in doing the same old exercise
cannot be condemned too vigorously. It is
better to spread the dosage of work around
the different parts of the body rather than to
concentrate too vigorously on the muscles of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
the waist. The continuous repetition of certain
movements results in fatigue, which causes
atonic conditions about the parts involved.</p>

<p>Regular exercises in the open air and getting
the abdominal muscles and organs in first
rate condition is the first step in securing
longevity of life and renewed vitality. This
will increase the appetite and strengthen the
voluntary muscles of defecation. Vigorous exercise
diverts the thoughts from business and
household cares and relieves an important factor
in constipation. Hill climbing, walking,
running, horseback riding, and all forms of
games are the best forms of exercise for the
cure of constipation. It so happens in many
cases that the individual is not physically fit
for such activities, and then the following exercises
cannot be used to advantage until the
patient is able to participate in recreative exercises
and games.</p>

<p>In the following exercises that of raising both
legs to a right angle from the lying position
is purposely omitted because of the severe action
on the abdomen and the paralyzing effect
on the sensitive nervous systems of that region.
Often an exaggerated condition of constipation
comes from this type of exercise.</p>

<p>In the following exercises it must be remembered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
that good posture is necessary for the
proper effect on the vital organs.</p>


<h2 class="nobreak" id="EXERCISES">EXERCISES FOR THE PREVENTION AND
CORRECTION OF CONSTIPATION</h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Exercise 1</span></p>

<p><i>Position</i>: Lying on back on floor, hands on
sides, legs straight.</p>

<p><i>Action</i>: Arch the body upward, forming a
bridge with the weight resting on the heels
and shoulders.</p>

<p><i>Remarks</i>: This is an excellent exercise before
retiring. It can be done ten to twenty
times without fatigue.</p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Exercise 2</span></p>

<p><i>Position</i>: Feet apart, arms side shoulder
level.</p>

take breath very slowly while bringing arms
up laterally till hands meet above head. Bring
arms back to sides very quickly and suddenly
exhale completely through mouth. Repeat three
to five times.</p>

above exercise by taking a deep breath and
counting fifty without taking more breath.</p>

<p>The above exercises should be indulged in as
you arise in the morning. They will give you
pep and vitality that is needed to carry on a
successful day. They will give the abdominal
organs the workout that will prevent and correct
constipation.</p>

<p>These exercises are in reality liver regulators.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
You will undoubtedly discover after
doing these exercises that you feel better in
every way.</p>

<p>It is essential to take several deep, long
breaths between each exercise. Do not do the
same exercises every morning. Pick out five
and do them vigorously for fifteen minutes.
There are enough exercises for six days of the
week; thus you will not become tired of the
monotony of exercises.</p>
